What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

That you decide when is necesary to saved your changes but keeping in mind that if you get distracted and you dont 
saved your changes when is logically enough , may be your files would be to big tpo saved and difficult to undestand.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

To change  files  at once that are connected themselves.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

checking the most recent change and compared with other file to see how many changes were made.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Because i can return the file to a previous stable version.
